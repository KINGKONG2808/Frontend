                Definition and Usage The display property sets or returns the element's display type. Elements in HTML are mostly "inline" or "block" elements: An inline element has floating content on its left and right side. A block element fills the entire line, and
                nothing can be displayed on its left or right side. The display property also allows the author to show or hide an element. It is similar to the visibility property. However, if you set display:none, it hides the entire element, while
                visibility:hidden means that the contents of the element will be invisible, but the element stays in its original position and size. Tip: If an element is a block element, its display type can also be changed with the float property. Definition
